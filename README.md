# Lab 3 - Generic $n^2-1$ puzzle

## Overview

This project solves the $n^2-1$ sliding puzzle (e.g., 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle) using the A* Search Algorithm. It supports puzzles of any size $n \times n$ and dynamically generates solvable puzzles.

## Features

- Solves $n \times n$ puzzles for any $n$.
- Uses A* with Manhattan distance heuristic.
- Metrics: solution length, nodes evaluated, and efficiency.
